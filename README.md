# Handwriting Analysis for Motor Skills Prediction - ALY 6020

## Overview
This project examines the potential of handwriting analysis, specifically digit classification, to assess motor skills in students. Employing KNN and neural network models, we analyze handwriting samples to identify patterns indicative of motor skill levels.

## Dataset
The dataset includes handwritten digit samples, each digit represented by pixel values. We use this data to train and test our KNN and neural network models.

## Methodology
- **KNN Model**: Implemented to classify handwritten digits, evaluating its effectiveness in recognizing diverse handwriting styles.
- **Neural Network Model**: A more complex model designed to capture intricate patterns in handwriting, enhancing prediction accuracy.

## Results and Analysis
- The KNN model showed a baseline accuracy, with varied performance across different digits.
- The neural network model demonstrated improved accuracy and consistency, highlighting its potential in handwriting analysis for motor skill assessment.

## Challenges
- **KNN Model**: Faced issues with high dimensionality and the selection of an optimal 'k' value.
- **Neural Network Model**: Complexity in design and training, along with the need for substantial computational resources.

## Conclusion
The analysis underscores the neural network model's superiority in handling complex handwriting patterns, suggesting its suitability for motor skills assessment in educational settings.
